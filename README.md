# UK-Census-Data
Data Engineering &amp; Analysis Project for UK Census Data

Summary
Description
I’m looking for an entry-level Data Engineer or Data Analyst to help me process and integrate UK Census 2021 Output Area data with the NSPL (National Statistics Postcode Lookup) dataset. This project is ideal for someone looking to build hands-on experience with geospatial or demographic data and contribute to a real-world dashboard used in the real estate sector.

Project Overview:
I’m building a real estate analytics dashboard on Signals BI, and want to enrich it with demographic and socioeconomic data from the latest census. The goal is to create a clean, structured dataset that links Census 2021 data to geographical units, including:

Postcode
Postcode Sector
Postcode District
Postcode Area
Census Output Area
Ward Name

The final output should be a grouped/aggregated dataset (in CSV or database-ready format) that includes calculated metrics for each area.

Tasks You’ll Handle:
Link Census 2021 Output Area data with the NSPL postcode data (both publicly available).
Create relationships between postcodes and geographic hierarchies (sector, district, area, ward, etc.).
